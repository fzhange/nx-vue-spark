The setup includes.

- a new Vue application at the root of the Nx workspace (src)
- a Cypress based set of e2e tests (e2e/)
- Prettier preconfigured
- ESLint preconfigured
- Vitest preconfigured

Let me explain a couple of things that might be new to you.
| **File** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **nx.json** | This is where we fine-tune how Nx works. We define what cacheable operations there are, and configure our task pipeline. More on that soon. |
| **project.json** | This file is where you can modify the inferred tasks for the NxVueSpark project. More about this later. |

::: tip
The concept of nx.json and project.json comes from nx team. If you want to know more about how to configure it? You can visit the official doc.
:::

## serve script

start, build and test your application.

```json
{
  "start": "nx serve", // start dev server
  "build": "nx build", // build application
  "test": "nx test", // runs tests using Jest
  "lint": "nx lint", // runs linting with ESLint
  "e2e": "nx e2e" // runs e2e tests with Cypress
}
```

More conveniently, we can also run them in parallel using the following syntax:

```bash
npx nx run-many -t test lint e2e
```

::: tip
quickly create a component in your repo.

```bash
npx nx g @nx/vue:component  index  --directory=src/components/hello-world
```

more functionality. Please look official doc

:::

## Caching

One thing to highlight is that Nx can cache the tasks you run.
